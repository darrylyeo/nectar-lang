# Nectar: The Human-Friendly Knowledge Graph

Hey, Repl.it-eers!

I'm proud to announce Nectar, a flexible, human-friendly language that helps you encode any kind of knowledge straight from your stream of consciousness.

## How does it work?

Build relationships between @nouns and #categories by writing regular English sentences:

```
@Nectar is a #human-friendly #language invented by @Darryl_Yeo and written with @Rust, @Web_Assembly, @TypeScript and @Deno.
```

Define properties

* 

Once you're done, query your results and output to CSV, JSON, YAML, SQL, GraphQL schemas, GUN.js, Neo4J, Grakn.AI, visualizations and much more!

The possibilities are endless:
* Keep an address book of people you've met and their connections
* Record scientific data
* Augment your wiki by cataloging characters, places, objects, and events from your favorite franchise
* Build a content management system for your websites and apps
* 

Features to add:
* Pronouns like "it", "this", "they" to reference subject of previous statements
* Timelines
* Automated reasoning/logical inferences
* Reactive properties
  * Bindings with JavaScript libraries like React, Vue, Svelte, RxJS
